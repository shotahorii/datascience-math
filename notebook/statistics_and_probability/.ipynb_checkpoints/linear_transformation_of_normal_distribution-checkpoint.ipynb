    "- This year, the upper half applicants of the university X passed the entrance exam based only on their exam score. \n",
    "- None of the applicants who got score in top 10% accepted the offer from the university X, whereas all other successful applicants accepted the offer. \n",
    "- The distribution of exam scores of all applicants follows $\\mathcal{N}(100,20^2)$\n",

    "**Q1. If you convert the distribution of exam scores of all applicants from $\\mathcal{N}(100,20^2)$ to $\\mathcal{N}(50,10^2)$, what's John's score?** \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the original score $X$ follows $\\mathcal{N}(100,20^2)$ and the converted score $Y$ follows $\\mathcal{N}(50,10^2)$. Let $Y=aX+b$, then $100a+b=50, a^2 20^2=10^2$. Hence, $a=\\frac{1}{2}, b=0$. John's converted score is $Y=aX+b=\\frac{1}{2}108+0 = 54$.\n",

    "**Q2. John's score is in upper A% of all applicants, upper B% of all those who passed the exam, and upper C% of all those who accepted the offer. Fill A,B and C.**\n",
